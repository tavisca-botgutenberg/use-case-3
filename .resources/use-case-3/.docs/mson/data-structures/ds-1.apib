## currency
+ currency: USD (string) - 3-character ISO code that indicates the currency in which you want to retrieve monetary amounts. The API calculates the amount equivalents and returns the amounts in the currency specified. For example, if the `currency` field value is set to `USD`, then the room rate, discount, taxes, and other monetary amounts are returned in their `USD` amount equivalents. We support all <a target="_blank" href="../reference-reads#currencies">ISO currencies</a>. If you want to configure multiple currencies, please contact cxLoyalty Business Team.<br><br>Consider a scenario where you set the `currency` field value to `USD` and the supplier's currency is in `AUD`. The API calculates the `AUD` to `USD` amount equivalents and displays monetary amounts in `USD`.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> If you do not provide the `currency` field, the `currency` field value will automatically be set based on the default account configuration.

## searchQueryRadial
+ searchQuery (searchQueryRadialInfo, required) - Contains the list of search criteria that must be used to search for hotels.

The response returns the result set only from the `pageNo` that you specify while considering the number of search results per page based on the `/paging/pageSize` field.<br><br>Consider a scenario where you set the `/paging/pageSize` field to `10`, which means that the response will return 10 search results per page. If you want the response to return the search results from the 21st search result (record) and skip (ignore) search results 1 to 20. In this scenario, you must set the `pageNo` field to `3`.<br><br><b>Default value:</b> `1`.
+ pageSize: 200 (number, required) - Indicates the number of search results (records) that the response must return per page.<br><br>For example, if you want the response to return `10` search results per page, set the `pageSize` field to `10`.<br><br><b>Default value and Maximum value:</b> `200`.

You can perform <@ three_level_sorting @> on the search results by using the following sorting parameters only - `price`, `rating`, and `distance`. The response returns the search results that are sorted based on the order of the sort criteria specified.<br><br>For example, if the `orderBy` field is set to `price asc, rating desc` the response returns the search results sorted based on an ascending order of price followed by the descending order of rating. The `price asc` sort criteria means that the hotel that has the lowest room rate must appear at the top of the result set, followed by the rest of search results based on their room rates.
The `rating desc` is the secondary sort criteria, which means that when there are multiple hotels with the same room rate, the response must then sort those search results based on the hotel's <@ starrating @>, where the hotel with the highest star rating must appear at the top of the result set.<br><br>Consider a scenario where three hotels have returned in the search results - Wayne Hotel whose room rate is $100 with a 5-star rating, ACME Hotel whose room rate is $100 with a 3-star rating, and Stark Hotel $300 with a 5-star rating.
If the `orderBy` field is set to `price asc, rating desc`, the result set is sorted based on the ascending order of price (cheapest room rate on top) followed by descending order of hotel rating (highest hotel rating on top) in the event where hotels have the same hotel room rates, and the search results are returned in the following order:<br>1. Wayne Hotel, $100, 5-star rating<br>2. ACME Hotel, $100, 3-star rating<br>3. Stark Hotel, $300, 5-star rating<br><br><b>Note:</b> If you do not provide the `orderBy` field, the `orderBy` field value will automatically be set based on the default account configuration. If no default setting is configured, then the `orderBy` field value is set to `price asc`.

## contentPrefs
+ contentPrefs (array [contentPrefsEnum], fixed-type) - Indicates the various types of <@ hotelcontentattributes_popup @> that you want to retrieve. By default, the `contentPrefs` field is set to `Basic`, which includes hotel ID, hotel name, <@ hotelchain @>, supplier hotel ID, supplier family, latitude and longitude coordinates, website URL, hero images, hotel rating, hotel currency code, and contact details (address, phone, and fax).<br><br>If you want to retrieve all types of hotel content attributes, set the `contentPrefs` field to `All`.<br><br>Consider a scenario where you want to retrieve only the <@ amenitiessmall @> and the policies of the hotel. In this scenario, you must set the `contentPrefs` field to `Amenities, Policies`.<br><br> The `contentPrefs` field ensures that the API consumers can choose what content they want the API to return based on their use case without compromising on the response size or latency. The static content for a hotel can be a large volume of data. Retrieving all this information at once can cause high latencies in e-commerce applications and low bandwidth devices. As a result, OTAs must ensure that they only retrieve content that they want to use or display on their application. The `contentPrefs` field takes care of this need. To retrieve hotel content attributes, we have categorized information into predefined groups of information that have common properties or related data to get rid of the need to specify each field when retrieving the hotel content attributes.

## contentPrefsRooms
+ contentPrefs (array [contentPrefsRoomsEnum], fixed-type) - Indicates the various types of <@ hotelcontentattributes_popup @> and room level content attributes that you want to retrieve. By default, the `contentPrefs` field is set to `Basic`, which includes hotel ID, hotel name, <@ hotelchain @>, supplier hotel ID, supplier family, latitude and longitude coordinates, website URL, hero images, hotel rating, hotel currency code, and contact details (address, phone, and fax).<br><br>If you want to retrieve all types of hotel and room level content attributes, set the `contentPrefs` field to `All, RoomAll`.<br><br>Consider a scenario where you want to retrieve only the <@ amenitiessmall @> and the policies of the hotel. In this scenario, you must set the `contentPrefs` field to `Amenities, Policies`.<br><br> The `contentPrefs` field ensures that the API consumers can choose what content they want the API to return based on their use case without compromising on the response size or latency. The static content for a hotel can be a large volume of data. Retrieving all this information at once can cause high latencies in e-commerce applications and low bandwidth devices. As a result, OTAs must ensure that they only retrieve content that they want to use or display on their application. The `contentPrefs` field takes care of this need. To retrieve hotel and room level content attributes, we have categorized information into predefined groups of information that have common properties or related data to get rid of the need to specify each field when retrieving the hotel and room level content attributes.
